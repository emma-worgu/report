          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Thank you for visiting the website located at <a href="/">www.bumper.com</a>, for
            downloading the Bumper App, or for visiting another affiliated website or downloading another affiliated
            mobile application that links to and utilizes this Privacy Policy (all platforms collectively referred to as
            the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). The Site is a web-based property of Bumper, LLC (&ldquo;Bumper,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) that enables end-user visitors to the Site
            (&ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;) to conduct searches of our databases of publicly available sources of information
            about individuals. This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which Bumper collects, uses, and discloses
            information about you when you access the Site. By accessing, viewing, downloading, or otherwise using the
            Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy, now and as amended or modified by us.</p>
          <h3>Information Collected by Bumper</h3>
          <p>Bumper is a database of publicly available sources of information aggregated for your convenience. Through
            Bumper, Visitors can access certain materials posted to or made available through the Site as compiled,
            distributed, and displayed by Bumper and other third-party content providers (&ldquo;Third-Party
            Providers&rdquo;) including, but not limited to, third-party websites or services that provide information
            about vehicles (each, a &ldquo;Searched Vehicle&rdquo;) that can be searched for and accessed through the
            Site (&ldquo;Bumper Searches&rdquo;).</p>
          <p>Bumper gathers three types of information: information that you submit to us, information that is collected
            automatically about your usage of the Site, and information about Searched Vehicles.</p>
          <h3>Information You Submit to Bumper</h3>
          <p>We collect information that you provide when you use the Site, including, but not limited to, when you
            submit an online application to become a Bumper member (&ldquo;Member&rdquo;), which enables you to utilize
            a host of services made available to Members by and through the Site (&ldquo;Member Services&rdquo;); when
            you conduct a Bumper Search; or when you contact us with a question, comment, or request. This can include,
            but is not limited to, your: (a) e-mail address; (b) full name; (c) company name; (d) date of birth; (e)
            password; (f) mailing address; (g) credit card information; and (h) information associated with a Searched
            Vehicle (such as a name, age or address) that you use to conduct a Bumper Search.</p>
          <h3>Information Collected Automatically About Your Usage of the Site</h3>
          <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
            information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
            referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this
            automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve
            services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.</p>
          <p>When you visit the Site, we or our third-party service providers may use a &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; &ndash; a
            small, text-only file that we save to your hard drive &ndash; or similar technologies to automatically
            collect and store non-personally-identifiable information about your usage of the Site such as your IP
            address, your browser type, the links and items you click on, ad impressions on your web browser, and the
            web pages you visit. Cookies enhance your experience at the Site, and are in many instances necessary for
            the provision of Member Services. For example, we use Cookies to store your password so you don&rsquo;t have
            to enter it more than once, and to recognize you if you return to the Site using the same web browser.</p>
          <p>If you do not want the Site to collect this information through Cookies, you may set your web browser to
            reject Cookies from the Site, or to inform you when a Cookie has been sent to your computer and provide you
            with the opportunity to refuse that Cookie. Each web browser is different, so please check your
            browser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Help&rdquo; menu to learn how to change your Cookie preferences. Please be advised
            that where you disable or reject Cookies, you may not be able to use the Member Services or experience the
            full functionality of the Site.</p>
          <p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by Bumper and our partners (such as
            marketing partners, data partners, analytics, financial, testing, optimization, and others), affiliates, or
            analytics or service providers (such as data providers, customer support, marketing, analytics, business
            development, affiliate, and other). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site,
            tracking users&rsquo; movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base
            as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an
            individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
          <p>When you download and use the Bumper Search App, where available, we also may collect your mobile
            device&rsquo;s unique identification number. We will not collect any precise geolocation information from
            you or your mobile device unless you expressly consent to such collection.</p>
          <p>Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based
            upon your Web browsing activity use programs that incorporate local stored objects (&ldquo;LSOs&rdquo;) such
            as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information on your computer. Various browsers may offer their own
            management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please <a
              href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">click
              here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h3>
          <p>We utilize third party ad networks, such as Google, to either display advertising on our Web site or to
            manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use cookies and Web beacons to collect
            non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted
            advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of
            serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a
              href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>. You may also visit <a
              href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> to learn about interest
            based advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating
            companies. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive
            generic ads.</p>
          <h3>Information About Searched Vehicles</h3>
          <p>In connection with providing the Bumper Searches, we collect information about Searched Vehicles from our
            third-party data providers.</p>
          <h3>Use of Information Collected by Bumper</h3>
          <p>We use the information that we collect from you for a number of purposes, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to provide you with products, services, or information you request, such as Bumper Searches and other
              Member Services;</li>
            <li>to process, or in connection with, any payments or transactions that you authorize;</li>
            <li>to verify that any credit card you submit is valid and active by charging, and thereafter immediately
              crediting, a small sum to the card upon registration;</li>
            <li>to send you service-related communications to verify and manage your Member account, about the Site,
              about the services you request, or containing required notices (where you have indicated a preference, we
              will only communicate with you via the medium you select, such as by e-mail or telephone);</li>
            <li>to respond to your inquiries;</li>
            <li>to deliver marketing communications or promotional materials that may be of interest to you, subject to
              other terms of this Privacy Policy;</li>
            <li>to generate and analyze statistics about your use of the Site (e.g., to determine the demographics of
              our Visitors);</li>
            <li>for internal business purposes (e.g., to analyze and manage our business, to allow us to better tailor
              the Site to our Visitors&rsquo; needs);</li>
            <li>to customize your experience on the Site; and</li>
            <li>to detect and protect against fraud, infringement, or other violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also may aggregate, anonymize, or merge any of the information we collect through the Site or elsewhere
            for these purposes, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy. This may include linking
            your Member account information with information collected through Cookies for purposes such as identifying
            what areas of the Site are most relevant to you and allowing us to better tailor the Site and our
            communications to your interests.</p>
          <p>When you submit a request to Bumper, we require that you provide an email address. Bumper only uses this
            email address to (i) send you an email to verify your request, (ii) communicate with you about questions you
            may ask concerning your request, and (iii) if you choose, to create a Bumper account to review the record(s)
            you provided on an ongoing basis. We will not sell the email address that you provide as part of this
            process, or use it for any other purpose, without your prior consent.</p>
          <p>Bumper uses data about Searched Vehicles to provide responses to Bumper Searches performed through the
            Site.</p>
          <h3>Sharing of Information Collected by the Site</h3>
          <p>We may share the information we collect from you with third parties for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>with affiliates and service providers who work on our behalf including, but not limited to: credit card
              processing companies to process your payments for goods and services and to verify that your credit card
              account is valid and active; e-mail service providers to send out e-mails on our behalf; sales partners to
              sell you our services; data partners to process data on our behalf (e.g., by removing duplicate
              information from user lists, by analyzing data); and marketing partners who may market our products to you
              on our behalf and provide analysis of such marketing efforts. These affiliates and service providers will
              have access to your information as needed to perform their functions on our behalf but we do not permit
              them to use your information for other purposes. In addition, apart from the circumstances described
              above, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties without your prior informed
              consent, although notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to share with third parties the fact
              that we have credit card information about you on file;</li>
            <li>in connection with providing the Bumper Searches, with certain third-party companies (such as data
              partners) for the sole and exclusive purpose of verifying information applicable to the particular
              Searched Vehicle. These third-party companies shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality
              regarding such information, and shall not themselves store, save, or transfer such information other than
              as necessary to perform the applicable verification services. We will not share the information of the
              Searched Vehicles for any other purpose;</li>
            <li>other than Sensitive Information (defined as a credit card number, financial account number, Social
              Security number, driver&rsquo;s license number, or credit score), with any third party to send you
              selected marketing offers. These businesses and third parties may include, but are not limited to: (a)
              providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
              suppression, and validation vendors; (b) e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers (where permitted by
              applicable law); (d) text-message-based marketers (where permitted by applicable law); (e) direct
              marketers; and (f) online advertising networks. While Bumper strongly encourages these third parties to
              adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Bumper is not responsible for their information
              practices, which are governed by their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy
              Policy;</li>
            <li>to any acquiring entity in connection with any sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer
              of substantial assets, reorganization, or liquidation of Bumper;</li>
            <li>to respond to a subpoena, court order, or legal process served on us or otherwise to comply with the
              law;</li>
            <li>when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights of Bumper, its parents, subsidiaries,
              affiliates, joint ventures, or third-party service providers, and each of their respective members,
              officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, co-branders, content licensors, suppliers,
              contractors, attorneys, and other partners, such as to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, the Terms and
              Conditions, and other applicable Bumper agreements and policies; and</li>
            <li>to protect the rights, property, or safety of you or others (e.g., by exchanging information with other
              companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes, by providing information to law enforcement
              where we believe the Site is being or has been used to commit unlawful acts).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not share precise geolocation information (such as collected from your mobile device) with third
            parties unless you expressly consent to such sharing.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may share aggregate reports comprised of the demographic, usage, and/or other
            characteristics of our Visitors as a group, which will never identify you personally, with third parties.
          </p>
          <h3>Correcting, Updating, or Removing Member Information</h3>
          <p>If the information you submit to us changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct,
            update, or request deletion of this information by making the change on your member information page or by
            contacting us at the contact information listed below.</p>
          <h3>Data Retention</h3>
          <p>We will retain the information that we have collected about you until you have requested deletion of the
            information. If you wish to cancel your Member account or request that we no longer use your information to
            provide you with services, please contact us at <a
              href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5d5d7ccd3c4c6dce5c7d0c8d5c0d78bc6cac8"><span class="__cf_email__"
                data-cfemail="29595b405f484a50694b5c44594c5b074a4644">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. However, we may
            retain some or all of your information after you request deletion or cancelation, as necessary, to comply
            with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
          <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>Bumper may amend or modify this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, from time to time in its sole
            discretion, effective immediately upon prominently posting a link to those changes on our Site&rsquo;s
            homepage or directly communicating them to you. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
            notify you here, at the e-mail address associated with your Member account, or by means of a notice on our
            home page prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of or access to the Site or any Member
            Services after any posted amendment or modification to this Privacy Policy or receipt of a Privacy Policy
            change notification e-mail constitutes an affirmative acknowledgment and acceptance by you of the amended or
            modified Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>We endeavor to keep all information that we collect from or about you protected both online and off-line.
            Unfortunately, no data security system or transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. As
            a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
            any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
          <h3>Marketing Opt-out</h3>
          <p>Where you receive marketing e-mails sent by us or one of our third-party advertisers, you may unsubscribe
            from receiving such marketing e-mails at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of the
            e-mail. We may maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes, so you may need to unsubscribe from
            multiple lists. However, even where you unsubscribe from all of our and our third-party advertisers&rsquo;
            lists, you may receive marketing e-mails in the future if you opt in to a different e-mail marketing
            program, although you can always unsubscribe from such programs as well by following the instructions
            contained at the end of the any e-mail you receive.</p>
          <p>You also may, at any time, notify Bumper that you do not wish to have Bumper disclose your information to
            third parties for the purposes of sending you marketing offers and promotions by visiting <a
              href="http://www.bv-email.com/">www.bv-email.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Information sent on behalf of third-party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so you may
            continue to receive e-mail from us or our third-party advertisers for up to ten (10) days after submitting
            an unsubscribe request as detailed above.</p>
          <h3>Links</h3>
          <p>The Site contains links to other websites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. In
            some instances, these websites are co-branded and the third parties are entitled to use Bumper&rsquo;s name

            websites, which shall be subject to those websites&rsquo; privacy policies. We encourage you to be aware

          <h3>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h3>
          <p>Bumper is very sensitive to the issue of children&rsquo;s privacy. The Site, as well as its products and
            services, are not developed for or directed at children. Visitors under eighteen (18) years of age are not
            eligible to use the Site and we do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from any Visitor
            that we actually know is under the age of eighteen (18). Bumper encourages parents and guardians to spend
            time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.
            If you believe that your child has provided Bumper with any personal information without your consent,
            please e-mail us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f3f1eaf5e2e0fac3e1f6eef3e6f1ade0ecee"><span

          <h3>Notice for California Residents</h3>
          <p>In addition to the above, the following, intended solely for California residents, concerns our handling of
            certain personally identifiable and/or personal information as required by the California Online Privacy
            Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act (collectively, &quot;CCPA&quot;). If you are a
            California resident, you may have additional rights where some of your &quot;Public&quot; and
            &quot;Personal&quot; information is concerned. If applicable, you may have the right to request that we
            disclose to you categories and specific pieces of Public information we may have obtained from public data
            sources and Personal information we may have collected directly from you, if any, and delete such, where
            required. Please note that we never sell Personal information obtained from you under any circumstances.</p>
          <h3>Categories of personal information we obtain, collect and/or disclose for business purposes:</h3>
          <p>Various methods for submitting requests are referenced above, as well as the specific types of Public
            information we obtain from publicly available data sources and/or Personal information we collect directly
            from our users. Per CCPA, in response to verified requests for disclosure, we will provide those
            &quot;categories&quot; of information we obtain or collect. The categories we have obtained or directly
            collected are: identifiers (such as name, address, email address); general geolocation information (e.g.,
            your city and state); and/or other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. We
            may disclose these categories of information about you or your use of the Site for business purposes (as
            defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law.</p>
          <h3>How categories of Personal information could be used:</h3>
          <p>We and our service providers may use the categories of Personal information we collect from and about you
            consistent with the various aforedescribed business purposes and/or as required by law. Please see the
            relevant sections above for more information.</p>
          <h3>Sale of Public information:</h3>
          <p>CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that &quot;sell&quot; personal information. We do not
            sell Personal information obtained from our site&#39;s visitors or subscribers, such as a name or email
            address provided when subscribing to our Site (unless such information happens to also be publicly available
            &quot;Public&quot; information that was NOT obtained from such visitors or subscribers but was instead
            obtained from publicly available data sources independent of anything visitors or subscribers may have
            provided us). As permitted by law and CCPA regulatory guidance, we may need to share certain limited
            information about your activity, for example through cookies (see above), with third parties in certain
            instances--you can control these cookies through browser settings--but this limited sharing would not
            constitute a sale of Personal information.</p>
          <h3>Non-discrimination for exercising your rights:</h3>
          <p>In addition to including information as to how you can exercise your rights under CCPA, please note that we
            will never discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA or any other rights. We will not deny you any
            access or service, charge you a different price, whether via a discount or other benefit, or impose fees or
            penalties, provide a different level of service, or the like (though CCPA permits such practices in some
            scenarios). CCPA permits companies to offer certain incentives that might result in different prices, rates
            or quality levels, but any CCPA-permitted financial incentive should reasonably relate to your
            information&rsquo;s value and contain written terms that describe the program&rsquo;s material aspects and
            participation in any such financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may
            revoke at any time. We do not engage in any such practices.</p>
          <h3>Authorized Agents:</h3>
          <p>You may authorize another person to submit a request on your behalf. Please note that before completing any
            requests, and in addition to our identification verification process, we are required to verify that your
            agent has been properly authorized to request information on your behalf and this may take additional time
            to fulfill your request.</p>
          <p>Upon receipt of a verifiable request, CCPA provides some California residents with such additional rights
            as follows:</p>
          <h3>Right to Know.</h3>
          <p>You may have the right to know and see the categories of data we have obtained, collected or shared about
            you over the past 12 months (or if we have not done so), including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the categories of Personal information we collected about you, or disclosed about you for a business
              purpose;</li>
            <li>the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;</li>
            <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting, obtaining or selling your personal information;</li>
            <li>the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information; and</li>
            <li>the specific items of Personal information we have collected or Public information we have obtained
              about you.</li>
          </ul>

            continuing your Right-to-know request, including any additional information needed concerning yourself so
            that we may search for applicable Personal information collected or Public information obtained that
            pertains to You. The information you provide must sufficiently match the information in our database to
            permit us to verify your request. An authorized agent may also make a request on your behalf.</p>
          <p>We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five days of receipt. If we
            require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
          <h3>Right to Delete.</h3>
          <p>You may have the right to request that we delete information we have obtained regarding, or collected
            directly from, you (and ask our service providers to do the same). However, we cannot delete Personal
            information that we are under a legal obligation to maintain and there are a number of other exceptions that
            include, but are not limited to, when the information is necessary for us or a third party to do any of the
            following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>complete and process your transaction;</li>
            <li>provide you with a product or service;</li>
            <li>perform a contract between us and you;</li>
            <li>protect your security and prosecute those responsible for breaching it;</li>
            <li>fix our system in the case of a bug;</li>
            <li>protect your or other users&rsquo; free speech rights;</li>
            <li>comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et seq.);</li>
            <li>engage in public/peer-reviewed research in the public interest, adhering to all applicable ethics and
              privacy laws;</li>
            <li>comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
            <li>make other internal and lawful uses of information compatible with the context in which you provided it.

          <h3>Right to ask us not to sell (also known as the right to opt-out).</h3>
          <p>As explained above, we do not sell Personal information obtained from our site&#39;s visitors or
            subscribers, such as a name or email address provided when subscribing to our Site (unless such information
            happens to also be publicly available &quot;Public&quot; information that was NOT obtained from such
            visitors or subscribers but was instead obtained from publicly available data sources independent of
            anything visitors or subscribers may have provided us). As for the Public information obtained from publicly
            available data sources, for many years now, we have accommodated requests to opt-out/not to sell/share such
            information, which can be done in various locations on the Site. For your convenience, you may also email us

            we will not sell such Public information that has been opted-out, we reserve the right to disclose Public
            information to third parties, without notice to you, if required to do so by law, or if we have a good faith
            belief that disclosure is necessary to (i) act in an emergency to protect someone&rsquo;s safety; (ii)
            comply with legal process served on us; or (iii) protect and defend our rights or property. We also reserve
            the right to transfer Public information to any successor-in-interest to our business.</p>

          <h3>In summary:</h3>
          <p>At no cost, you may request information each year regarding any disclosure of your Public or Personal
            information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. You
            have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above. To request
            access to or deletion of your information, or to exercise any other data rights under California law, please
            contact us using one of the methods set forth above.</p>
