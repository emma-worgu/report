          <p>These Terms and Conditions (collectively, the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;), together with our <a
              href="/policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, represent the legally binding agreement
            between you (&ldquo;You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your&rdquo;) and Bumper, LLC (&ldquo;Bumper,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;We,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Us&rdquo;).</p>
          <p>Bumper is a database of publicly available sources of vehicular information (&ldquo;Bumper Data&rdquo;)
            aggregated for Your convenience, intended for personal individual use purposes, that makes available
            services that allow users to search for a vehicle information (each, a &ldquo;Search Subject&rdquo;) as
            permitted by these Terms, such as to learn of data that may pertain to your vehicle&rsquo;s estimated market
            value, warranty, recalls, accident record and other uses. Through Bumper, end-user visitors to the Site can
            view and/or access certain content, information, media, text, data, images, graphics, user interfaces,

            products, services, software functionality and other materials posted to or made available through the Site
            (collectively, &ldquo;Content&rdquo;) as compiled, distributed and displayed by Bumper and other third-party

          <h3><strong>3. Class Action Waiver, Mandatory Arbitration, Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</strong></h3>
          <p>BY USE OF THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO OUR MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT
            GENERALLY REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY
            TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE. You
            acknowledge and agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between You and Us (including against any
            of Our employees, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors or assigns) relating to the
            Site or related websites, the Content, Bumper Data, related services and materials, any related transaction
            or relationship and/or Your information, including, without limitation, tort and contract claims, claims
            based upon any federal, state or local statute, law, order, ordinance or regulation, the issue of
            arbitrability, shall be resolved by the final and binding arbitration procedures set below. You further
            acknowledge and agree that any such claims shall be brought solely in Your individual capacity and not as a
            plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding, or private attorney general
            capacity. Similarly, you agree that any controversy concerning whether a dispute is arbitrable shall be
            determined by the arbitrator and not by a court and the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
            person&rsquo;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
            You voluntarily and knowingly waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
          <p><strong>BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO
              TO COURT AND YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>. In arbitration, disputes are resolved by neutral
            arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal than a court trial, however, an
            arbitrator can award relief.</p>
          <p>Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above, You hereby waive any right to bring or
            participate in any class action in any way related to, or arising from, these Terms or the matters that they
            describe. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any
            dispute(s) You may have and is non-severable from this agreement to arbitrate claims.</p>
          <p><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS ACTION
              LITIGATION AND CLASS ARBITRATION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US, OUR AGENTS, OFFICERS,
              SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR
              ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR
              REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU
              MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND NOT USE OUR SITE, BUMPER DATA OR OUR SERVICES.</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms shall be treated as though they were executed and performed in New York, NY and shall be
            governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict
            of law principles).</p>
          <p>At Bumper, We expect that Our customer service team will be able to resolve most complaints You may have

            complaint, You can contact Our customer service team as described in the &ldquo;How to Contact Us&rdquo;
            section below. In the unlikely event that Your complaint remains unresolved, We prefer to specify now what
            each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later. Accordingly, You and Bumper agree to the
            following resolution process for all disputes and claims that You or Bumper may have arising from Our
            provision, or Your use, of our Site and its services, such as Bumper Data (each a &ldquo;Service
            Claim&rdquo;).</p>
          <p>In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of any Service Claim, You and Bumper agree
            to first discuss the Service Claim informally for at least 30 days. To do that, the party who brings the
            Service Claim must first send to the other party a notice that must include (1) a description of the Service

            description and proposed resolution by email ( <a

            subsequently discuss Your Service Claim with You, We will contact You using the e-mail address or mailing
            address You provide in Your letter to Us. If Bumper wants to raise a Service Claim, We will send You the
            aforementioned description and claim notice to You at the e-mail address that We have on file for You. If We
            do not have an e-mail address for You on file, Bumper will send Our Service Claim to You through a means
            that complies with the service of process rules of the State of New York.</p>
          <p>IF YOU AND BUMPER DO NOT REACH AN AGREED UPON RESOLUTION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE SERVICE CLAIM,
            YOU AND BUMPER AGREE THAT THE SERVICE CLAIM MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL (NOT CLASS)
            ARBITRATION WITH <a href="https://www.arbresolutions.com/">ARBITRATION RESOLUTION SERVICES INC.</a>
            (&ldquo;ARS&rdquo;) USING ITS RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMISSION OF DISPUTES INVOLVING
            BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS, <a href="https://www.arbresolutions.com/how-it-works/">AVAILABLE HERE</a>. If
            ARS is unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties&rsquo; dispute for any reason, the arbitration shall
            be administered and conducted by a widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to
            the parties, if possible under any rules by such organization applicable to disputes between business and
            consumers, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their consent.</p>
          <p>EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT: EITHER PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO PURSUE: AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
            CLAIM OR CLAIM RELATING TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO DATA THROUGH THE SITE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
            CLAIMS RELATING TO PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, SERVICE MARK AND TRADE SECRETS AND CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
            ACCESS OR RETRIEVAL OF DATA THROUGH THE SITE USING AN AUTOMATED PROCESS SUCH AS SCRAPING) IN STATE OR
            FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NY. BOTH BUMPER AND YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF
            THOSE COURTS FOR THESE CLAIMS.</p>
          <p>NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE ANY PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THE STATE OR
            FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NY IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS PENDING AN OUTCOME IN ARBITRATION.</p>
          <p>TO HELP RESOLVE ANY ISSUES BETWEEN US PROMPTLY AND DIRECTLY, YOU AND BUMPER AGREE TO BEGIN ANY ARBITRATION
            OR COURT PROCEEDINGS ALLOWED UNDER THIS SECTION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES AND AGREE TO WAIVE THE
            RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.</p>
          <p>Rather than force everyone to visit Us in New York, ARS&rsquo; arbitration contemplates arbitration without
            travelling anywhere, but instead via their cloud-based platform. Disagreements regarding the forum for
            arbitration will be settled by an ARS arbitrator.</p>
          <p>When the 30-day period described above has elapsed, You may, as an individual (but not as a class) initiate
            the arbitration through the process described in ARS&rsquo;s Business and Individual Rules. If You initiate
            the arbitration, Your arbitration fees will be limited to the Application filing fee set forth by ARS rules.
            You and Bumper acknowledge, understand and agree that any decision or award rendered by ARS may be entered
            in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>If the arbitrator rules against Bumper, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the
            arbitrator, We think it fair that Bumper reimburse Your reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs,
            regardless of who initiated the arbitration. By contrast, if the arbitrator rules in Bumper&rsquo;s favor,
            We will not seek reimbursement of Our attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the
            arbitration.</p>
          <p>This is a Class Action and Trial Waiver. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE
            TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US. THE ARBITRATOR&rsquo;S
            DECISION OR AWARD WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT
            JURISDICTION.</p>
          <h3><strong>4. Modifications to these Terms</strong></h3>
          <p>We may modify these Terms, in whole or in part, from time to time in Our sole discretion, effective

          </ul>

          <p>IV. Fees, Taxes and Billing</p>
          <p>If You wish to use the Site&rsquo;s services or otherwise purchase any product or service through the Site,
            You will be presented with the applicable fees and billing arrangement prior to Your purchase, which include
            the charging of fees to a payment card <strong>on a recurring basis</strong>. By ordering a subscription
            and/or any product via our Site, You authorize Us to charge your card accordingly. As with any merchant, for
            Your protection, we may request additional information to authenticate the credit card being used, and
            absent successful authentication, we may refuse to accept an order. If you believe that your credit card or
            other payment method might have been used in a fraudulent manner to purchase Bumper Data, please contact our
            customer service department as soon as possible. We do not accept payment via check, cash or money order.
            <strong>In addition to the applicable subscription or order fees, depending upon the state in which you
              reside, either You, or We on Your behalf, are responsible for paying any and all applicable sales or use
              tax due to any and all taxing authorities arising from, or in connection with, Your use of the
              Site&rsquo;s services.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>All orders are subject to applicable taxes in the states where an applicable customer resides and
              You authorize us to take all appropriate measures to comply with any and all applicable laws and statutes
              in connection with the foregoing.</strong></p>
          <p>BY SUBMITTING PAYMENT, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU (A) ARE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AND
            (B) HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE PAYMENT MEANS SELECTED BY YOU. By supplying payment card information,
            You authorize Our use of such information in accordance with Our Privacy Policy, including, but not limited
            to, Our provision of such information to third parties for the purposes of payment processing. You also
            understand and acknowledge that Bumper uses a third-party payment processor to process credit card payments
            on Our behalf, and when You supply payment information in connection with a purchase, You agree that Bumper
            is not responsible for the security of such information when it is in the control of the third-party payment
            processor.</p>
          <p>You specifically acknowledge and agree that <strong>failure to use the Site&rsquo;s services does not
              constitute a basis for refusing to pay subscription or other fees</strong>. Upon prior written notice to
            You (with e-mail constituting sufficient written notice), Bumper reserves the right in its sole discretion
            to change its pricing and/or billing practices. If You do not agree with these changes, You are always free
            to cancel Your subscription, but you recognize that You will remain responsible for timely payment of any
            and all fees that You have already incurred (including any applicable late fees). We will understand that
            Your continued use of Your subscription following Our providing notice of any change constitutes and means
            that you consent to any and all such changes and by not terminating Your account within seven (7) days after
            delivery of such notice, You formally agree to comply with, and be bound by, such new pricing or billing
            practices.</p>
          <p>If You fail to make any scheduled payment for accrued fees, such overdue amounts may be subject to interest
            charges in the amount of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, compounded monthly, or the
            maximum amount permitted by law. Your account may be deactivated, and access to the Site denied, for
            non-payment.</p>
          <p>Additionally, You acknowledge and agree that We may refuse to accept or may cancel any order, whether or
            not the order has been confirmed, for any or no reason (e.g., orders we suspect to be fraudulent, associated
            with fraudulent activity, previously fraudulent order history or previous credit card disputes), and without
            liability to You or anyone else. If Your payment card or payment method has already been charged for an
            order that we subsequently cancel, We will issue You a refund as applicable. If You have any questions in
            this regard, please feel free to contact our customer service department toll-free at 1-332-225-9745.</p>

          <h3><strong>18. Refund Policy</strong></h3>
          <p>If at any time You are not fully satisfied with Our services for any reason, You may call Our customer

          <p>As occurs with other online merchants, intentional credit/debit card reversals and chargebacks are

            authorities. Please be advised that We regularly monitor all internet protocol address information and other
            user activity and that this information may be used in a civil and/or criminal case against any customer,
            especially in instances of possible theft or fraudulent behavior.</p>
          <h3><strong>20. Equitable Relief</strong></h3>
          <p>You agree that any breach or threatened breach of these Terms or any unauthorized or unlawful use of the
            Site or Bumper Data would result in irreparable injury to Bumper for which monetary damages would be
            inadequate. In such event, Bumper shall have the right, in addition to other remedies available to it at law
            and in equity, to immediate injunctive relief without the need to post a bond. Nothing contained in these
            Terms shall be construed to limit any legal or equitable remedies available to Bumper.</p>
          <h3><strong>21. Entire Agreement</strong></h3>
          <p>These Terms, the <a href="https://www.bumper.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, and all other
            applicable operating rules, policies, price schedules and other supplemental terms and conditions or
            documents that may be published or agreed upon by You from time to time, which are expressly incorporated
            herein by reference, shall constitute the entire and only agreement between You and Bumper with respect to

          <p>To the extent that any information or material that appears on or is posted to the Site, or otherwise is

            with these Terms, these Terms shall take precedence unless revised terms or conditions are contained in a
            signed writing by one of Our duly appointed officers.</p>
          <h3><strong>22. Force Majeure</strong></h3>
          <p>Other than for payment obligations, neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of,
            these Terms on account of either party&rsquo;s delay or failure to perform as required under these Terms as
            a result of any causes or conditions that (a) are beyond the party&rsquo;s reasonable control (including,
            but not limited to, obvious acts of G-d, including storms and other natural occurrences; fires; explosions;
            telecommunications, Internet, or other network failures; results of vandalism or computer hacking; national

            and (b) the party is unable to overcome through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence ((a) and
            (b), collectively, a &ldquo;Force Majeure Event&rdquo;). If any such Force Majeure Event occurs, the
            affected party will give the other party notice and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
            impact of any such event.</p>
          <h3><strong>23. Severability</strong></h3>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by any applicable court decision, that
            provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the invalid or
            unenforceable provision within the limits of applicable law or the applicable court decision, and the
            remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <h3><strong>24. Waiver</strong></h3>
          <p>Bumper&rsquo;s failure to enforce a specific right or remedy for any breach of, or insist upon strict
            adherence to, any provision of these Terms shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of
            Bumper&rsquo;s right to enforce its remedies for breaches of, or insist upon strict adherence to, such
            provision or any other provision of these Terms. Any waiver of a provision of these Terms must be contained
            in a signed writing by a duly appointed officer of Bumper.</p>
          <h3><strong>25. Misconduct</strong></h3>
          <p>Bumper reserves the right to restrict, suspend or terminate Your Account or access to the Site if We
